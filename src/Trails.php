/**
 * Craft plugins are very much like little applications in and of themselves. We’ve made

 *
 * For the purposes of the plugin docs, we’re going to assume that you know PHP and SQL,
 * as well as some semi-advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and PHP namespaces.

         * Logging in Craft involves using one of the following methods:
         *
         * Craft::trace(): record a message to trace how a piece of code runs. This is mainly for development use.
         * Craft::info(): record a message that conveys some useful information.
         * Craft::warning(): record a warning message that indicates something unexpected has happened.
         * Craft::error(): record a fatal error that should be investigated as soon as possible.
         *
         * Unless `devMode` is on, only Craft::warning() & Craft::error() will log to `craft/storage/logs/web.log`
         *
         * It's recommended that you pass in the magic constant `__METHOD__` as the second parameter, which sets
         * the category to the method (prefixed with the fully qualified class name) where the constant appears.
         *
